# Intraspecific_Variation_Walleye_Respirometry

This repository contains the data and code that supports the manuscript: "Intraspecific Variation in Metabolic Responses of a Cool Water Fish to Increasing Temperatures" by Jackson S.A., Lucas K.N, Wehrly K.F., and Alofs K.M.

Briefly this manuscript investigates the role of intraspecific variation in response to increasing temperatures among several rearing pond populations of Walleye (Sander vitreus).

**Raw and Processed Respirometry Files From AutoResp** - Contains raw respirometry data are in the form of txt files provided by AutoResp (Loligo, Denmark).

**Acute and Acclimated - Metabolic Rate Calculation** folders contain the code and the resulting files from processing the raw data from AutoResp with the FishResp package in R.

The resulting final set of data for all Walleye can be found in the **Metabolism.Data.csv** 

All analysis and figures were conducted in the **Metabolism.Analysis.R file**.
